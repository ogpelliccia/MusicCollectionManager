# Music Collection Manager
This project, which I created during my time in college, is an ASP.NET MVC application that is meant to store data about songs, which also includes their albums, artists, and even credits. As it is, it can show the user records from each table in the database, and editing, deleting, and adding records may or may not be possible depending on the table.

For the database, I originally used Microsoft SQL Server, but I have recently converted it to SQLite for easier deployment and use. Because of that, I am able to provide you with the database through the .db file in the repository.

## How to Use
Since this is an ASP.NET project, nothing really needs to be compiled and I have everything ready to work after extracting the repo.

To run the website:
1. Extract the zip file somewhere on your computer.
2. Open "MusicCollectionManagerSQLite.sln" in Visual Studio 2022
3. Make sure that the play button on top says "IIS Express" next to it
4. Click the play button or press F5, which will start the web app with debugging
